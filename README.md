# PI Visualizations
In honor of PI day ( March 14th ), here are some quick visualizations of the first million digits of PI.

I worked in Google Colab and used Numpy, Pandas and Plotly predominately for these manipulations and visualizations.

- This site and paper offers PI calculated to 10,000 digits.
