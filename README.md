# PI Visualizations
In honor of PI day ( March 14th ), here are some quick visualizations of the first million digits of PI.

I worked in Google Colab and used Numpy, Pandas and Plotly predominately for these manipulations and visualizations.

References:

1. "Ramanujan, Modular Equations, and Approximations to Pi or How to compute One Billion Digits of Pi***" by D.H. Bailey, J.M. Borwein and P.B.Borwein. Here's a link to it: https://www.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/papers/borwein/
- This site and paper offers PI calculated to 10,000 digits.

2.  piday.org publishes PI to one million digits, accessible here: https://www.piday.org/million/.  Using this site, I created the text file included in this project containing PI to one million digits.  Many thanks to them for posting!
